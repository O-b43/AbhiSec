# About (The Five W's)

## ***Who*** Am I?
I am a:
- *father* to the cutest little girl I know
- *husband* to the most loving wife I know
- *son* to the best parents I know
- *pet parent* to two of the most *purr*fect cats I know
- *volunteer* in my local community and profession
- *security engineer* with a plethora of curiosity, because I know there's a ton I don't know!

Words I try to live by:
- "Leave a place better than you found it"
- "Be the resource for someone now that you wish you had back then"

My *mission* as a *lifelong learner* is searching for *balance* between striving for perfection and accepting the imperfections of being human.

## **What** is this site for?
This is a place to share my:
- *Write-ups* for various security challenges
- *Scripts* I've written to enhance my use of security tools
- *Experiences* in setting up testing environments for hands-on security research

## **When** did this journey start?
In *February of 2021*, I decided to change careers from Information Technology to Cyber Security--Offensive Security, to be precise. During my initial interview I was asked to work on a Hack-The-Box Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge and report back my findings in a follow-up interview.

On *May 4th, 2021*, I published a write-up of the CTF on my old blog: 0b153c.dev (no longer up). I had intended to add more write-ups but "life happens" and my blog got stale... The old blog site is still accessible via [archives]().

## **Why** am I rivisiting this now?
After working in the Cyber Security space for years, I'm curious how the *knowledge* and *experiences* I've gained have enhanced my ability to *communicate* the importance of this work in an *impactful* way. By pointing my skills and effort towards security challenges, such as CTFs, I'm able to showcase all of it in a *safe* and *secure* way. Additionally, by making this topic more approachable, I hope it aids someone--anyone--who's either on a similar journey, or thinking about starting one of their own.
